# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the backend application and provides guidance on security best practices.

## Security Improvements

The following security improvements have been implemented:

1. **Updated Dependencies**: All dependencies have been updated to versions with known security fixes.
2. **CORS Configuration**: CORS has been configured with specific origins, methods, and headers instead of using wildcards.
3. **Security Headers**: HTTP security headers have been implemented using Flask-Talisman.
4. **Input Validation**: Input validation for API endpoints to prevent injection attacks.
5. **Input Sanitization**: Sanitization of user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
6. **Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting on all API endpoints to prevent abuse.
7. **Improved Authentication**: Enhanced token validation and error handling.
8. **Secure Session Configuration**: Secure and HttpOnly flags for cookies.
9. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling to prevent information disclosure.

## How to Use Security Features

### 1. Security Headers

The application uses Flask-Talisman to implement security headers. No additional configuration is needed.

```python
# This is already configured in server.py
from security_headers import configure_security_headers
configure_security_headers(app)
```

### 2. CORS Configuration

CORS is configured in `security_headers.py`. To modify allowed origins:

```python
# Modify in security_headers.py
def get_cors_config():
    return {
        'resources': {r"/api/*": {
            'origins': ["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"],
            # Add more origins as needed
        }}
    }
```

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

Use the validation and sanitization functions from the security module:

```python
from security import validate_review_input, sanitize_review_input

# Validate input
validation_errors = validate_review_input(data)
if validation_errors:
    return jsonify({"errors": validation_errors}), 400
    
# Sanitize input
sanitized_data = sanitize_review_input(data)
```

### 4. Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is applied as a decorator to API endpoints:

```python
from security import rate_limit

@app.route('/api/endpoint')
@rate_limit
def api_endpoint():
    # Your code here
```

### 5. Authentication

Improved token validation is handled in `get_user_from_token`:

```python
# Already implemented in server.py
token = request.headers.get('Authorization').split('Bearer ')[1]
user_data = get_user_from_token(token)
```

## Security Audit

Run the security audit script to check for security issues:

```bash
python security_audit.py
```

This will generate a report with:
- Vulnerable dependencies
- Code security issues
- Missing security headers
- Authentication security issues
- Recommendations for improvements

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to fix security vulnerabilities.
2. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input.
3. **Authentication**: Use secure authentication methods like JWT with proper validation.
4. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production.
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information.
6. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on all endpoints to prevent abuse.
7. **Content Security Policy**: Use CSP to prevent XSS attacks.
8. **Database Security**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
9. **Logging**: Implement logging for security events.
10. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits.

## Additional Security Enhancements

Consider implementing these additional security measures:

1. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA for user accounts.
2. **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations.
3. **Password Strength Requirements**: Enforce strong password policies.
4. **Account Lockout**: Implement account lockout after failed login attempts.
5. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest.
6. **Security Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for security events.
7. **Regular Backups**: Implement regular data backups.
8. **Access Control**: Implement proper authorization and access control.
9. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Run regular vulnerability scans.
10. **Security Training**: Provide security training for developers.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to security@example.com with details of the vulnerability. Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.
