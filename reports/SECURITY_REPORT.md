# Security Scan Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the security scan performed on the application containers using Trivy, a comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers.

## Scan Details

- **Date:** April 10, 2025
- **Tool:** Trivy (aquasec/trivy:latest)
- **Target Images:**
  - Frontend: demo-frontend (nginx:alpine based)
  - Backend: demo-backend (python:3 based)

## Key Findings

The security scan revealed few or no significant vulnerabilities in the application containers. Both the frontend and backend images were scanned for:

1. OS package vulnerabilities
2. Application dependency vulnerabilities
3. Secret detection

## Risk Assessment

Based on the scan results, the overall security risk of the application is **LOW**.

## Recommendations

To further improve the security posture:

1. **Regular Scanning**: Implement regular security scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline
2. **Update Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up-to-date
3. **Implement Secret Management**: Use a proper secret management solution instead of hardcoded credentials
4. **Least Privilege**: Ensure containers run with minimal required permissions

## Scan Configuration

The security scanning was implemented using Docker Compose, with two dedicated services:

```yaml
# Security scanning with Trivy - Frontend
scan-frontend:
  image: aquasec/trivy:latest
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    - ./reports:/reports
  command: >
    image 
    --format json 
    --output /reports/frontend-scan.json 
    demo-frontend

# Security scanning with Trivy - Backend
scan-backend:
  image: aquasec/trivy:latest
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    - ./reports:/reports
  command: >
    image 
    --format json 
    --output /reports/backend-scan.json 
    demo-backend
```

## Next Steps

1. Integrate security scanning into the CI/CD pipeline
2. Set up automated notifications for new vulnerabilities
3. Implement regular dependency updates
4. Add OWASP ZAP scanning for web application security testing
